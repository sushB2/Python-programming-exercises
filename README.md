1.	Level description
Level	Description
Level 1	Beginner means someone who has just gone through an introductory Python course. He can solve some problems with 1 or 2 Python classes or functions. Normally, the answers could directly be found in the textbooks.
Level 2	Intermediate means someone who has just learned Python, but already has a relatively strong programming background from before. He should be able to solve problems which may involve 3 or 3 Python classes or functions. The answers cannot be directly be found in the textbooks.

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).

Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:

HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
#----------------------------------------#

#----------------------------------------#
Question 10
Level 2

Question:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world
#----------------------------------------#

#----------------------------------------#
Question 11
Level 2

Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010
Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Question 17
Level 2

Question:
Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
D 100
W 200

D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

Question 18
Level 3

Question:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1
#----------------------------------------#

#----------------------------------------#
Question 19
Level 3

Question:
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

Question 20
Level 3

Question:
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.
